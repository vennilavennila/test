            <p>There are no ugly stones on the beach. But there is this <br>
               stones that is full of ugly scars-largely,grayish black scars <br>
            seem inbedded in its very heart.some of us like this stone. <br>
            We are scarred by our sufferings and heartaches. looking <br>
            closely at the stone, I notice whitish colors surrounding the <br>
             blemishes, which somehow offset the gloom evoked y the <br>
            black scars. I search in my mind,"Do we have whitish colors <br>
             of peace,faith, and fortitude that could sustain through the <br>
            vicissitudes in our lives?"The stone doesn't bury itself and its <br>
            ugliness in the sand but instead, it lives amoung its peers <br>
            without shame or fear. once more I peer in my mind,"when we<br>
           are distraught by sufferings, do we wade through life carrying<br>
           these scars without rancor in our hearts? Or do we hide in our<br>
           shell of reclusion and lose all desired to realize our dreams <br>
           and yearn to love and be loved again? Do we bury ourselves in<br>
           the sandstrome of self-pity?" I have kept the stone to remind<br>
            me that in every sorrow, there is a seed of hope, and that<br>
            beneath the surface of every scars, lies a treasure chest of<br>
        goldern opportunities.</p>
